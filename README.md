## Why OpenCowork

OpenCowork is built for people who want an agent that does more than chat. It can open websites, operate a headed browser, call CLI tools, run reusable skills, persist task history, and now connect to or expose standard MCP servers.

It is designed for fast iteration on real desktop workflows: research, operations, internal tools, demos, browser automation, and repeatable task execution.

## Current Product Direction

The current work stream is converging around a result-centric task model:

- task runs are recorded as reusable `TaskRun` records,
- completed work persists into `TaskResult`,
- history is shifting toward outcomes, artifacts, and rerun links,
- templates can be created from successful runs and executed with parameters,
- scheduler and IM surfaces now reuse the same task/result semantics.

## Highlights in v0.10.10

- Standard MCP client support for remote `streamable-http` endpoints such as LangChain Docs MCP.
- Standard MCP server mode with a `/mcp` endpoint, while keeping legacy `/tools` compatibility.
- A clearer MCP UI split into `Clients` and `Server Mode`.
- Better follow-up continuity across agent turns using thread reuse.
- Safer long-running conversations by preventing screenshot payloads from blowing up model context.
- Improved browser search flows with `pressEnter` support for input actions.
- Stronger memory, task history, and restore foundations for real multi-step work.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability         | What it enables                                               |

| MCP Server         | Expose OpenCowork capabilities to other MCP clients           |
| Task History       | Persist task results, steps, and recovery state               |
| Human-in-the-loop  | Pause, resume, interrupt, and take over tasks                 |
| International UI   | English-first UI with Chinese support                         |

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Python 3.8+ for selected skills
- A valid LLM API configuration in `config/llm.json`

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonGaoHaining/opencowork.git
cd opencowork
npm install
```

### Configure your model

Create `config/llm.json`:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4-mini",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "timeout": 60000,
  "maxRetries": 3
}
```

### Run the desktop app

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

## Example Prompts

```text
Open Baidu, search for a company, and summarize what it does.
Create a company overview PPT from the information on the page.
Connect an MCP tool and use it to fetch LangChain docs examples.
Open the generated PPT file.
```

## MCP Support

OpenCowork now supports both sides of MCP:

- As an MCP client, it can connect to standard remote MCP servers.
- As an MCP server, it can expose tools through a standard `/mcp` endpoint.

Examples:

- Connect to `https://docs.langchain.com/mcp` from the MCP client panel.
- Enable server mode and expose selected OpenCowork tools to external clients.

## Open Source Status

OpenCowork is moving from an internal fast-iteration agent into a stronger open-source developer product. The current release is best suited for builders who want:

- a desktop automation foundation,
- an MCP-native local agent shell,
- a skill-based extensibility layer,
- and a project that is actively shipping core agent infrastructure.
