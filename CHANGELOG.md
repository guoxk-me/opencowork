# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenCowork are documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Focus

This work stream is converging OpenCowork toward the v0.12 task-model and template layer, with a stronger emphasis on reusable task runs and result-centric product surfaces.

### Highlights

- Added persistent `TaskResult` storage and wired task completion to save results automatically.
- Unified task result exposure across the main run panel, history, scheduler, and IM surfaces.
- Added template creation from successful runs and parameter validation for template execution.
- Added parameterized template execution in the template center with separate run inputs.
- Added result-oriented history filters for source, outcomes, runs, templates, and artifacts.
- Added `View Run` entry points from IM recent tasks and history records.
- Added tests for template input validation, result repository persistence, and template creation from runs.

### Notes

- v0.12 is still in progress; the core task/result/template loop is now in place, but final product polish and broader scenario coverage remain.

## v0.10.10 - 2026-04-18

### Release focus

This release turns OpenCowork into a much stronger MCP-native desktop agent while improving continuity across long multi-step tasks.

### Highlights

- Added standard MCP client support for remote `streamable-http` endpoints.
- Added standard MCP server mode at `/mcp` while keeping legacy `/tools` compatibility.
- Shipped a redesigned MCP panel with separate `Clients` and `Server Mode` tabs.
- Improved follow-up task continuity by reusing thread context across turns.
- Added `list_mcp_tools` and MCP catalog awareness so the agent can discover connected MCP tools.
- Fixed MCP tool argument forwarding so direct top-level parameters now work correctly.
- Prevented screenshot payloads from exploding model context in long-running threads.
- Improved browser input flows with `pressEnter` support.
- Refined i18n coverage and MCP UI wording.

### MCP and Agent Improvements

- Connected OpenCowork to standard remote MCP servers such as LangChain Docs MCP.
- Exposed OpenCowork capabilities through a standard MCP server implementation.
- Added explicit MCP transport support with backward-compatible config normalization.
- Reduced repeated MCP tool reload churn with tool-signature deduplication.
- Improved agent awareness of MCP tools through prompt and tool-catalog updates.

### UX Improvements

- Split MCP management into clearer client and server workflows.
- Improved follow-up task handling so users can continue work in the same task thread.
- Tightened model-visible tool result summaries to keep longer sessions usable.

### Notes

- Some browser understanding tasks may still overuse screenshots compared with extraction-first flows.
- Desktop opener commands such as `xdg-open` may succeed on the host system even when the command is reported as timed out. This will be improved in a future patch.
