# OpenCowork User Guide

This guide explains how to use OpenCowork as a desktop AI work system for browser automation, local execution, reusable task runs, templates, skills, IM workflows, and MCP tools.

## What OpenCowork Does Best

OpenCowork is strongest when a task requires more than one model response:

- opening websites and operating a headed browser,
- collecting and summarizing information,
- generating files or structured results,
- calling local tools and reusable skills,
- using MCP-connected services,
- receiving tasks from IM and returning result files,
- saving successful work as reusable templates.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LeonGaoHaining/opencowork.git
cd opencowork
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Model

Create `config/llm.json` with your provider, model, and credentials.

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-5.4-mini",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "baseUrl": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
  "timeout": 60000,
  "maxRetries": 3
}
```

For image analysis and OCR through IM attachments, use a model deployment that supports image input.

### 3. Keep Local Config Private

- Keep all files under `config/` local to your device.
- `config/` is git-ignored and should not be committed or published.
- `config/feishu.json` contains live IM credentials and must never be pushed to GitHub.

### 4. Launch the App

```bash
npm run electron:dev
```

## Main Product Areas

### Chat and Task Execution

Use the main input box to give the agent a concrete goal. OpenCowork can plan the task, operate the browser, run CLI actions, call installed skills, use MCP tools, and continue across follow-up prompts when the task stays in the same active thread.

Good prompt examples:

```text
Open Baidu and search for a company, then summarize what it does.
Create a five-slide company intro deck from the research findings.
Use LangChain Docs MCP and give me a minimal Python example.
Analyze this uploaded product screenshot and return a concise report.
```

### Live Preview and Human Oversight

The preview area shows browser and agent activity in real time. You can observe execution, approve high-impact actions, pause or resume work, interrupt active tasks, or take over when manual control is safer.

### Result Delivery

When a task completes, OpenCowork surfaces the result in the sidebar so you can review the final outcome without scrolling through the full chat.

Result delivery can include:

- final summary,
- structured data,
- generated files,
- screenshots,
- artifact links,
- run details,
- template and scheduler actions.

### History and Runs

Task history stores prior executions, results, steps, and outcomes. The current product direction is result-centric: summaries, artifacts, run links, and template links are more important than raw step logs alone.

Use history and runs to:

- inspect what happened,
- find successful work,
- rerun useful tasks,
- save a run as a template,
- debug failures and recovery behavior.

### Templates

Templates turn successful work into reusable automation.

You can:

- save a successful run as a template,
- edit template metadata and parameters,
- run a template again with new inputs,
- add a template to the scheduler,
- trigger template-like workflows from IM.

### Skills

Skills are reusable capability modules stored under `~/.opencowork/skills/`.

Current skill workflows include:

- listing installed skills,
- browsing available skills,
- previewing skill metadata,
- installing or updating skills,
- running specialized capabilities such as presentation generation.

### MCP Client

Open the MCP panel and use the `Clients` tab to connect external MCP servers.

Supported endpoint types:

- local `stdio` servers,
- remote standard `streamable-http` endpoints.

Once connected, the agent can discover and call MCP tools during task execution.

### MCP Server Mode

OpenCowork can expose selected capabilities to external MCP clients through a standard `/mcp` endpoint while preserving a legacy `/tools` compatibility path.

Use server mode when another MCP-capable app or agent should call OpenCowork.

### IM and Feishu File Workflows

OpenCowork supports file-driven IM workflows through Feishu:

- send a text task plus an attached file or image,
- send only a file and let OpenCowork create a default task,
- receive generated result files and images back through Feishu,
- ask follow-up questions about a just-uploaded image.

Current behavior:

- incoming Feishu attachments are downloaded to the local app data directory,
- the agent receives the local file path as task context,
- image attachments can use OCR or general image analysis through the vision path,
- result file artifacts can be uploaded back to Feishu after task completion.

## Agent Runtime Observability

OpenCowork now includes the first reusable local Agent Runtime baseline:

- shared protocol for task events, approvals, outputs, artifacts, and errors,
- one runtime API for Electron, Scheduler, IM, MCP, and future clients,
- unified approval policy across browser, desktop, visual, CLI, MCP, and skills,
- Plan Mode for read-only analysis before execution,
- trace and diff artifacts for audit-grade observability.

In the task runs panel, run details can include:

- runtime trace status, mode, event counts, and recent events,
- trace artifacts such as full CLI logs and workspace diff files,
- loaded workspace rules from `AGENTS.md`,
- changed file summaries for completed or failed tasks.

Runtime defaults are read from `config/runtime.json` when present. If the file is missing or invalid, OpenCowork falls back to safe defaults and continues running.

See `docs/SPEC_P5_agent-runtime-platformization.md` for the detailed plan.

## Recommended Prompt Style

Best results come from prompts that specify:

- the site, file, or tool to use,
- the target outcome,
- the output format,
- whether follow-up actions are allowed,
- whether the task should be saved as a reusable workflow.

Example:

```text
Open the target website, collect the pricing table, summarize changes in markdown, save the result, and offer to turn this into a weekly template.
```

## Known Behavioral Notes

- Desktop and hybrid computer-use support is still productizing and should be treated as an active development area.
- Some text-centric browser tasks may still overuse screenshots before falling back to extraction.
- MCP tool choice is improving, but some tools may still require a retry when the model first under-specifies parameters.
- Long-running desktop opener commands can succeed on the host even when the current executor reports a timeout.

## Troubleshooting

### The agent cannot use an MCP tool

- Confirm the MCP client connection is active.
- Open the MCP panel and verify tools are listed.
- Ask the agent what MCP tools are available.

### A follow-up task loses context

- Make sure the task is continued in the same active thread.
- Avoid manually resetting the current task state between turns.

### An IM image task says the model cannot analyze the image

- Check that your `config/llm.json` model deployment supports image input.
- Confirm the uploaded file is a supported image type such as `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, or `.bmp`.
- Retry with a smaller or clearer image if the model response is incomplete.

### A browser task extracts noisy content

- Ask the agent to target a narrower page region.
- Prefer article, table, result container, or main content selectors over `body`.
